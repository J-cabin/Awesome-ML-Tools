# Awesome-ML-Tools

- [中文版](https://github.com/J-cabin/Awesome-ML-Tools/blob/master/README-CN.md)

Why did I create this project:

1. There are many projects that summarize machine learning materials and courses, but there are not many projects that summarize machine learning tools.
2. I read [《ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 101》](http://www.montreal.ai/ai4all.pdf), which introduces some tools. So an idea hit me that organizes more useful tools from time to time.

## Development Environment

> Note: For the GPU selection section, [《Which GPU(s) to Get for Deep Learning》](http://timdettmers.com/2019/04/03/which-Gpu-for-deep-learning/) is very well written. This article was also translated into [Chinese version](http://blog.itpub.net/31562039/viewspace-2641060/) in April 2019.
